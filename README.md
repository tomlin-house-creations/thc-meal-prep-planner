# THC Meal Prep Planner

A comprehensive meal planning and preparation application designed to simplify weekly meal planning, recipe management, and grocery shopping.

## Overview

THC Meal Prep Planner helps users plan their meals efficiently by providing tools to:

- 📅 Plan weekly meals with a visual calendar interface
- 📖 Manage and organize recipes with ingredients and instructions
- 🛒 Generate automated shopping lists from meal plans
- 📊 Track nutritional information for recipes and meal plans
- ⏱️ Estimate preparation and cooking times

## Features

### Current Status

This project is in early development. The following features are planned:

- **Recipe Management**: Create, edit, and organize recipes
- **Meal Planning**: Weekly meal calendar with drag-and-drop interface
- **Shopping Lists**: Auto-generated lists based on selected meals
- **Nutrition Tracking**: Calculate nutritional values for recipes and plans
- **Meal Prep Guides**: Step-by-step preparation workflows

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python (planned)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript/React (planned)
- **Database**: TBD
- **Deployment**: TBD

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tomlin-house-creations/thc-meal-prep-planner.git
cd thc-meal-prep-planner

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start: Generate a Meal Plan

Try out the meal plan generator to see the system in action:

```bash
# Run the meal plan generator
python scripts/generate_meal_plan.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads a sample user profile from `profiles/ashuah.md`
- Reads available recipes from `recipes/`
- Applies constraints from `constraints/sample_constraints.yaml`
- Uses LLM for creative suggestions (if API key is configured)
- Generates a weekly meal plan in `plans/meal_plan_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

**To customize:**
- Add more recipes to `recipes/` folder (use `breakfast-burritos.md` as a template)
- Create your own profile in `profiles/` folder
- Adjust planning rules in `constraints/sample_constraints.yaml`
- Enable LLM features (see [LLM Integration](#llm-integration) below)

The script includes thorough ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) documentation, making it perfect for learning how the system works!

### LLM Integration

The meal plan generator can use AI (GPT) to provide creative meal suggestions while maintaining all constraints.

#### Enabling LLM Features

**Local Development:**

Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-api-key-here"
python scripts/generate_meal_plan.py
```

**GitHub Actions:**

1. Navigate to your repository settings
2. Go to **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your OpenAI API key (starts with `sk-`)
6. Click **Add secret**

The CI workflow is already configured to use this secret automatically.

#### How LLM Integration Works

- **Creative Suggestions**: GPT proposes meal ideas based on your preferences
- **Constraint Compliance**: All suggestions must pass hard constraint validation
- **Graceful Fallback**: If LLM is unavailable, the generator uses deterministic selection
- **Recipe Matching**: LLM suggestions are matched to available recipes in your database

**Note**: The script works perfectly without an API key - LLM features are optional!
