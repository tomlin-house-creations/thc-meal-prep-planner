## Description

Hearty breakfast burritos filled with scrambled eggs, black beans, peppers, and cheese, all wrapped in a warm flour tortilla. Perfect for meal prep - make ahead and freeze for quick weekday breakfasts. Can be customized with your favorite toppings and easily adapted for dietary preferences.

## Ingredients

### For the Filling
- 8 large eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/2 medium onion, diced (about 1/2 cup)
- 1 medium bell pepper (red or green), diced (about 1 cup)
- 1 can (15 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese
- 1/2 teaspoon cumin
- 1/2 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)

### For Assembly
- 4 large flour tortillas (10-inch)
- 1/2 cup salsa (optional, for serving)
- 1/4 cup sour cream (optional, for serving)
- 1 avocado, sliced (optional, for serving)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Vegetables
Dice the onion and bell pepper into small, uniform pieces. Drain and rinse the black beans, then set aside.

### Step 2: Scramble the Eggs
In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk until well combined. Season with salt and pepper.

### Step 3: Cook the Vegetables
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced onion and bell pepper. Sauté for 5-7 minutes until softened and lightly browned.

### Step 4: Add Beans and Seasonings
Add the drained black beans to the skillet with the vegetables. Sprinkle in cumin and chili powder. Stir to combine and cook for 2-3 minutes until beans are heated through.

### Step 5: Cook the Eggs
Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour the egg mixture into the skillet with the vegetables and beans. Gently scramble, stirring occasionally, until eggs are just set but still slightly moist (about 3-4 minutes). Remove from heat.

### Step 6: Add Cheese
Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the egg mixture and stir gently to combine. The residual heat will melt the cheese. If using, fold in fresh cilantro.

### Step 7: Warm the Tortillas
Heat tortillas in a dry skillet for 15-20 seconds per side, or wrap in a damp paper towel and microwave for 20-30 seconds until pliable.

### Step 8: Assemble the Burritos
Place a warmed tortilla on a clean surface. Spoon about 1/4 of the egg mixture into the center of each tortilla, leaving about 2 inches of space on each side.

### Step 9: Wrap the Burritos
Fold in the sides of the tortilla, then roll from the bottom up, tucking tightly as you roll to create a compact burrito. Repeat with remaining tortillas and filling.

### Step 10: Serve or Store
Serve immediately with optional toppings (salsa, sour cream, avocado). For meal prep, wrap each burrito tightly in aluminum foil or parchment paper and refrigerate for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
