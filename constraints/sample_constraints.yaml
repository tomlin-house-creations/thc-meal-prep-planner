# Sample Constraints for Meal Plan Generation
# 
# This file demonstrates how to define constraints for the meal plan generator.
# Think of constraints as the "rules" the generator must follow when creating a plan.

# Week Configuration
week:
  # Which week are we planning for?
  start_date: "2026-01-20"  # Tuesday (YYYY-MM-DD format)
  end_date: "2026-01-26"     # Monday

# Meal Requirements
# How many of each meal type do we need for the week?
meals_per_day:
  breakfast: 1  # One breakfast per day
  lunch: 1      # One lunch per day  
  dinner: 1     # One dinner per day
